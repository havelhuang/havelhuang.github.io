Hi there! My name is Wei Huang. I am a PhD student in Computer Science Department at University of Liverpool. I am supervised by [Dr. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/) and [Dr. Xingyu Zhao](https://x-y-zhao.github.io/). Prior to study at University of Liverpool, I received my MSc degree at Imperial College London and BSc degree at Xiamen University.

Reseach Interest
======
My research interest remains in the field of AI safety. Machine learning models are suffering from the adversarial threats, like evasion attack, backdoor attack. I investigate into the attack and defence algorithms and develop the testing and verification methods for different machine learning models, including Ensemble Trees, CNNs, RNNs etc.
