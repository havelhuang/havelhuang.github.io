Hi there! My name is Wei Huang. I am currently a researcher at Purple Mountain Laboratories. I obtained my PhD in the Computer Science Department at the University of Liverpool and was supervised by [Dr. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/) and [Dr. Xingyu Zhao](https://www.xzhao.me/). Prior to study at University of Liverpool, I received my MSc degree at Imperial College London and BSc degree at Xiamen University.


Reseach Interest
======
My research interest remains in the field of AI safety. Machine learning models are suffering from the adversarial threats, like evasion attack, backdoor attack. I investigate into the attack and defence algorithms and develop the testing and verification methods for different machine learning models, including Ensemble Trees, CNNs, RNNs etc.
