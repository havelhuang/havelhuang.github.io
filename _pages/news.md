- (05/2022) I am honored to have my doctoral reseach featured in the university's news column: ["Becoming an Expert: Safety Problems in Learning-enabled Autonomous System"](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/news/articles/becoming-an-expert-safety-problems-in-learning-enabled-autonomous-system).
- (07/2021) I am one of the winners of the [SIEMENSE AI-DA challenge](https://ecosystem.siemens.com/topic/detail/default/33), which concerns how to assess the dependability of machine learning models. Specifically, I win the “most original approach” award. There are 32 teams from 15 countries participated in this challenge. News can also be found in the [university website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/electrical-engineering-electronics-and-computer-science/news/articles/computer-science-phd-student-scoops-siemens-ai-dependability-student-challenge-award).
